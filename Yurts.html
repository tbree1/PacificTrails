                <h3><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></h3>
                <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
                    Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a
                    roof dome that can be opened.</p>

                <h3><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
                <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
                    gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity
                    and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
                    facilities are located in the lodge.</p>

                <h3><strong>What should I bring?</strong></h3>
                <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
                    changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
                    bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p>
